To change the amount of Generations for the GA you have to change the I value in the Main class so that it stops after a certain
period of time.

To change the values of how many Chromosomes there are and how many testsPerChromosomes the values are located in the Collection
Class, Just change them to what you deem appropriate. Also the values for mutation/crossover and elitism are located here so feel
free to modify them too.

As submitted the code will run the GA, Hill Climber and Random, to modify this just comment out the appropriate functions within
the main class to see each of them run individually.
